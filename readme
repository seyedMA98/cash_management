# Cash Management System

This is a Cash Management System built using Django and Django Rest Framework. The system allows users to manage their cash flow by creating and updating transactions, tracking balances, and generating reports.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project both with Docker and without Docker.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your local machine:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Docker (optional, only if you want to use Docker for deployment)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

#### Without Docker

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd cash_management
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```shell
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```shell
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the project dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Apply database migrations:

   ```shell
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Run the development server:

   ```shell
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

#### With Docker

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```shell

   ```

3. Build the Docker image:

   ```shell
   docker build -t cash-management-app .
